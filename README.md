# website-project
The goal of this project is to create a website from scratch or using a pre-made template. 
The website should include at least three different pages (or three different distinct navigation sections in the case of a single page site).
It should maintain consistent style and navigation across pages. 
It should also contain the core HTML elements, and should ideally be "responsive" when the window is resized, for example to mobile device width.
